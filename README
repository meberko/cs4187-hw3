Steps for making and testing:

Making:
  1.  You should have copies of the files contained in the zip with this
      README which are owned by the primary user. Navigate to the Makefile
      directory and run
        > make
      the make command will create the executable hwcopy.

      *******************************************************
      *  HWCOPY CAN ONLY BE RUN AS THE USER THAT RUNS MAKE! *
      *******************************************************

Testing:
  1.  Ensure that you are acting as the user who ran make!
  2.  Run

        > make test

      The output should be reasonably easy to read.
      Tests 1, 2, and 3 should produce success messages, diff the input files
      with the output files, and report that they are identical.
      Test 4 and 5 try to tunnel their way out of the document root and output
      area, respectively. Appropriate error messages are reported in either
      case.
      Test 6 tests the ability to successfully parse "/../" in a filename. It
      should report similarly to tests 1, 2, and 3.

  3.  If the -c flag is not used, the default .config file that comes zipped
      with this program will be used.

      DocumentRoot and OutputArea should be of the form /absolute/path/to/root
      (/ at the front, no / at the end).

      Aliases should be of the form /alias/ /path/to/alias (surrounding /'s on
      on first argument, same path format as above for second argument).

      An example of how given filenames and aliases are handled using the
      following config settings:

          DocumentRoot /home/mike/input
          OutputArea /tmp/hw3
          Alias /alias/ /hw3

      So, given a command:

        > /alias/test.txt test.txt

      will copy /home/mike/input/hw3/test.txt to /tmp/hw3/test.txt.

   4. You can either run

        > ./hwcopy

      and have the program read lines from stdin to your heart's content, or
      you can run

        > echo "<input_file> <output_file>" | ./hwcopy

      to run a single copy.
