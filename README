Steps for making and testing:

Making:
  1.  You should have copies of the files contained in the zip with this
      README which are owned by the primary user. Navigate to the Makefile
      directory and run
        > make
      the make command will create the directory /home/user/bin where the
      executable files for encdec, encrypt, decrypt, password, and keyfile
      commands will be stored.

Testing:
  1.  Ensure that you are acting as the user who ran make!
  2.  Testing is difficult because you must use your own config to access
      directories that exist on your machine. If the -c flag is not used, the
      default .config file that comes zipped with this program will be used.

      DocumentRoot and OutputArea should be of the form /absolute/path/to/root
      (/ at the front, no / at the end).

      Aliases should be of the form /alias/ /path/to/alias (surrounding /'s on
      on first argument, same path format as above for second argument).

      An example of how given filenames and aliases are handled using the
      following config settings:

          DocumentRoot /home/mike/input
          OutputArea /tmp/hw3
          Alias /alias/ /hw3

      So, given a command:

        > /alias/test.txt test.txt

      will copy /home/mike/input/hw3/test.txt to /tmp/hw3/test.txt.

   3. You can either run

        > ./hwcopy

      and have the program read lines from stdin to your heart's content, or
      you can run

        > echo "<input_file> <output_file>" | ./hwcopy

      to run a single copy.
